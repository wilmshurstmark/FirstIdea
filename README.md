# FirstIdea

This program is a basic Edit (Levenshtein) Distance routine that calculates the difference 
between two words.

These differences can either be additional, replacement or deleted characters between the two words.

It uses recursion, so might not be that fast if scaled up.

Some code ideas have been borrowed from the great www.
